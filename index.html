                Portugal Solo Trip
                10/04/22 by 4th-time traveler Violet
                What a great trip! I started out not knowing anyone and finished with 29 friends. I had a great time,
                ate fabulous food and enjoyed beautiful scenery. Rafi was a great and knowledgeable tour guide.
                Excellent!
                05/10/22 by 3rd-time traveler Gena
                This was my first solo tour but it won't be my last. My fellow travelers were wonderful and easy to get
                along with. The hotels were all comfortable, spacious, and accommodating. The food was delicious in
                every hotel restaurant and tour venue.

            <h1>Best Time to Travel</h1>
            <p>The gigantic Kruger National Park (about the same size as Israel or Wales) is big enough to offer
                something for everyone.

                With diverse wildlife, including the Big Five (with an estimated 1,500 lions but heavily threatened
                rhinos,) Kruger’s excellent road network means that most areas are accessible even with two-wheel drive
                vehicles.

                Often derided for being “tame wilderness” because of tarred roads and good infrastructure, this huge
                park measures 414 kilometers from Crocodile Bridge in the south to Pafuri Gate in the north – for added
                wilderness appeal it is recommended to head farther into the less-visited tracks and trails of the
                north.

                For first-timers: For the independent traveler with a hired vehicle, Kruger is arguably the cheapest and
                most accessible of all Africa’s major parks. Sabi Sand Game Reserve shares a 50-kilometer unfenced
                border with Kruger National Park and it benefits from incredible wildlife viewing (along with possibly
                the best leopard spotting in the world.)

                For old hands: Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal offers some of the best cheetah sightings,
                huge leopards, a rare chance to see both the black and white rhinos and a bird list of well over 400
                species.
