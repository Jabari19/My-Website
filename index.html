                    Portugal Solo Trip
                    10/04/22 by 4th-time traveler Violet
                    What a great trip! I started out not knowing anyone and finished with 29 friends. I had a great
                    time,
                    ate fabulous food and enjoyed beautiful scenery. Rafi was a great and knowledgeable tour guide.
                    Excellent!
                    05/10/22 by 3rd-time traveler Gena
                    This was my first solo tour but it won't be my last. My fellow travelers were wonderful and easy to
                    get
                    along with. The hotels were all comfortable, spacious, and accommodating. The food was delicious in
                    every hotel restaurant and tour venue.

                <h1>Best Time to Travel</h1>
                <p>The gigantic Kruger National Park (about the same size as Israel or Wales) is big enough to offer
                    something for everyone.

                    With diverse wildlife, including the Big Five (with an estimated 1,500 lions but heavily threatened
                    rhinos,) Kruger’s excellent road network means that most areas are accessible even with two-wheel
                    drive
                    vehicles.

                    Often derided for being “tame wilderness” because of tarred roads and good infrastructure, this huge
                    park measures 414 kilometers from Crocodile Bridge in the south to Pafuri Gate in the north – for
                    added
                    wilderness appeal it is recommended to head farther into the less-visited tracks and trails of the
                    north.

                    For first-timers: For the independent traveler with a hired vehicle, Kruger is arguably the cheapest
                    and
                    most accessible of all Africa’s major parks. Sabi Sand Game Reserve shares a 50-kilometer unfenced
                    border with Kruger National Park and it benefits from incredible wildlife viewing (along with
                    possibly
                    the best leopard spotting in the world.)

                    For old hands: Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal offers some of the best cheetah
                    sightings,
                    huge leopards, a rare chance to see both the black and white rhinos and a bird list of well over 400
                    species.
