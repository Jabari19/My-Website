                Portugal Solo Trip
                10/04/22 by 4th-time traveler Violet
                What a great trip! I started out not knowing anyone and finished with 29 friends. I had a great
                time,
                ate fabulous food and enjoyed beautiful scenery. Rafi was a great and knowledgeable tour guide.
                Excellent!

                This was my first solo tour but it won't be my last. My fellow travelers were wonderful and easy to
                get
                along with. The hotels were all comfortable, spacious, and accommodating. The food was delicious in
                every hotel restaurant and tour venue.
